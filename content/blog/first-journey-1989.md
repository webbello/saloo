# The First Journey: Breaking New Ground

In 1989, Neena and I embarked on what would become a historic journey - the first circumnavigation of the globe by car covering six continents. What started as an ambitious dream became a reality that would change our lives forever.

## The Beginning

The idea seemed impossible to many. Circumnavigate the globe by car? Cover six continents? The logistics alone were staggering. But we had a vision, and more importantly, we had the determination to see it through.

## Challenges We Faced

### Bureaucratic Hurdles
- Visa applications for multiple countries
- Customs documentation
- International driving permits
- Insurance complications

### Physical Challenges
- Extreme weather conditions
- Mechanical breakdowns
- Fatigue and exhaustion
- Navigation difficulties

## The Achievement

After 69 days, 19 hours, and 5 minutes, we had done it. We had covered 45,000 kilometers across six continents, becoming the first people to achieve this feat by car.

The Guinness Book of World Records certified our achievement, and we were officially recognized as the first and fastest circumnavigators of the globe.

## What It Meant

This journey wasn't just about setting a record. It was about proving that with determination and perseverance, seemingly impossible dreams can become reality. It put Kolkata, our beloved city, on the world map of motor rallying.

*"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but the journey around the world begins with a single dream."* - Our philosophy that guided us through every challenge.
