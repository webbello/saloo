# Breaking the British Army Record

When the Guinness Book of World Records dropped our "first" title in 1991, citing the British Army's achievement, we knew we had to act. This is the story of how we reclaimed our place in history.

## The Challenge

The British Army had completed their circumnavigation in 40 days, but they had advantages we didn't:
- No customs delays
- No visa problems  
- No airport bureaucracy
- Royal Air Force backup

We decided to prove that civilian determination could beat military efficiency.

## Preparation

This time, we were more prepared:
- Better route planning
- Improved vehicle maintenance
- Streamlined documentation
- Mental preparation for the challenge ahead

## The Journey

Starting from Delhi on November 7, 1991, we were determined to not just match the Army's time, but to beat it decisively.

### Key Moments
- **Day 15**: Mechanical issues in Europe tested our resolve
- **Day 25**: Weather delays in North America
- **Day 35**: The final push across Asia

## The Victory

39 days, 20 hours, and 15 minutes. We had done it - beating the British Army's record by 3 hours and 45 minutes, covering 40,535 kilometers.

*"It gave me great pleasure to have defeated the British Army"* - Saloo's words upon completing the journey.

## The Significance

This wasn't just about speed. It was about proving that with the right mindset, civilians could achieve what seemed impossible, even against military precision and resources.
