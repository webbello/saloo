# From Kolkata to the World: Our Guinness World Record Story

When we started our journey from Kolkata in 1989, we never imagined that our names would be etched in the Guinness Book of World Records forever. Today, as I reflect on that incredible achievement, I'm filled with pride not just for what we accomplished, but for what it meant for our beloved city and country.

## The Dream That Started It All

Growing up in Kolkata, we were always fascinated by stories of great explorers and adventurers. The idea of circumnavigating the globe by car seemed like something out of a fantasy novel. But sometimes, the most impossible dreams are the ones worth chasing.

## Making History

Our first circumnavigation in 1989 took us 69 days, 19 hours, and 5 minutes to complete. We covered 45,000 kilometers across six continents, becoming the first people in history to achieve this feat by car. The Guinness World Records officially recognized our achievement, cementing our place in history.

But we didn't stop there.

## Breaking Our Own Record

In 1991, we decided to challenge ourselves again. This time, we aimed to break the existing record held by the British Army. The pressure was immense - we weren't just competing against others, we were competing against our own legacy.

The result? We completed the circumnavigation in just 39 days, 20 hours, and 15 minutes, beating the British Army record by 3 hours and 45 minutes. We had not only broken a record but had also proven that determination knows no boundaries.

## What This Meant for India

Our achievement wasn't just personal - it was a moment of pride for India. We had shown the world that Indians could compete and excel on the global stage of adventure and motor rallying. Letters poured in from across the country, with people expressing how our journey had inspired them to pursue their own dreams.

## The Guinness Recognition

Receiving official recognition from Guinness World Records was surreal. The meticulous documentation process, the verification of our route, the confirmation of our timing - every detail was scrutinized. When the certificate finally arrived, it felt like holding a piece of history in our hands.

## Legacy and Inspiration

Today, when young adventurers from India and around the world reach out to us, sharing their own impossible dreams, we're reminded of why we took on this challenge. It wasn't just about the record - it was about proving that with courage, determination, and unwavering support for each other, any dream is achievable.

Our names in the Guinness Book of World Records represent more than just a fast time around the globe. They represent the spirit of adventure, the power of partnership, and the belief that ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things.

*"Records are meant to inspire, not just to impress. If our journey encourages even one person to chase their impossible dream, then every mile was worth it."*
