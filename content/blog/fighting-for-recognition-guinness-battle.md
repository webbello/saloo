# Fighting for Recognition: Our Battle with Guinness World Records

Sometimes achieving a world record is just the beginning of the battle. Our journey to proper recognition by Guinness World Records became a fight that lasted over a decade - a fight not just for ourselves, but for the principle that achievements should be acknowledged fairly, regardless of nationality.

## The Problem with Recognition

When we completed our first circumnavigation in 1989, covering six continents in 69 days, 19 hours, and 5 minutes, we expected proper recognition from Guinness World Records. We had done something unprecedented - become the first people to circumnavigate the globe by car.

But when the Guinness Book was published, something was wrong. They had not properly mentioned our record. Most importantly, they had ignored the word "first" while mentioning our achievement. When we contacted them, the Guinness officials told us it was done due to "lack of print space."

**Lack of print space?** For a world record that had never been achieved before?

## The Injustice

This wasn't just about recognition - it was about accuracy and fairness. We had:
- Meticulously documented our entire journey
- Followed all Guinness protocols
- Provided comprehensive evidence
- Achieved something that had never been done before

Yet somehow, our historic achievement was being minimized. The omission of the word "first" might seem small, but it was everything. It was the difference between being pioneers and being just another entry in a record book.

## Taking Legal Action

In 1993, we made a difficult decision. We filed a lawsuit against Guinness Book of World Records Limited, demanding ₹36 crore in damages at the Kolkata High Court. This wasn't about money - it was about principle.

The court understood the gravity of the situation. Based on our petition, they passed an interim order restraining Guinness Book of World Records Limited from publishing, printing, and distributing their book without properly including our feat.

## The Promise and Betrayal

Immediately after the court order, Guinness officials approached us. They promised they would include our record properly in future editions. More than that, they promised something extraordinary - they would hold a rally in 2000 called the "Millennium Challenge" to honor our feat.

We had detailed discussions, and it was mutually agreed that a trophy would be instituted in the name of Saloo Chowdhury. Believing in their good faith, we withdrew our petition.

But in March 2001, the company informed us that "for good reasons" they were not in a position to fund the event. We had been planning to participate and had even paid more than US$11,000 as entry fee.

## The Bigger Battle

This time, we decided not to wait quietly. In 2003, we filed a damages suit of ₹166 crore against Guinness Book of World Records Limited at the Kolkata High Court.

People asked why such a large amount. The answer was simple: "This is what I have lost. I couldn't participate in any international event because the millennium challenge was promised to me."

But it was more than financial loss. It was about:
- **Credibility**: Our achievement being properly recognized
- **Opportunity**: Missing out on international events and sponsorships
- **Principle**: Ensuring fair treatment regardless of nationality
- **Legacy**: Setting a precedent for future record holders

## Why This Mattered

Our battle wasn't just personal. It represented something larger:

### Fighting Bias
We believed we were being treated unfairly because we were Indian. In our own words: "They cheated me because I am Indian. I will not let them do that."

### Setting Precedent
If established organizations could minimize achievements arbitrarily, what message did that send to future adventurers and record seekers?

### Demanding Accuracy
World records are about facts. If the facts aren't recorded accurately, the entire system loses credibility.

## The Principle Behind the Fight

At 60 years old, when most people would have given up, we continued fighting. This wasn't about ego - it was about ensuring that:
- Achievements are recognized fairly
- Documentation matters
- Promises are kept
- Justice prevails regardless of geography

## Lessons Learned

Our legal battle taught us several important lessons:

### Documentation is Everything
Keep meticulous records of every communication, every promise, every agreement.

### Persistence Pays
Sometimes the fight for recognition is longer than the achievement itself.

### Principle Over Convenience
Standing up for what's right is often inconvenient and expensive, but it's necessary.

### Global Recognition Requires Local Strength
Sometimes you need to fight in your home courts to get global recognition.

## The Ongoing Legacy

While our legal battle continued, we never stopped adventuring. We were already planning our third circumnavigation attempt, determined to prove that our achievements spoke louder than any controversy.

Our fight with Guinness World Records became part of our story - not the main chapter, but an important one that showed we were willing to fight for proper recognition of Indian achievements on the global stage.

## Reflection

Looking back, our battle with Guinness World Records was about more than just our personal recognition. It was about ensuring that achievements are acknowledged fairly, that promises are kept, and that the spirit of adventure and record-breaking remains pure.

We didn't just circumnavigate the globe - we fought to ensure that our circumnavigation was properly recognized. Both journeys required the same qualities: determination, persistence, and an unwavering belief in what's right.

*"Sometimes the fight for recognition is as important as the achievement itself. We didn't just break records - we fought to ensure those records were properly acknowledged."*
