They were flagged from Delhi on November 7, 1991. This time, they covered 40,535 kilometres in a record time of 39 days, 20 hours, 15 minutes — 3 hours and 45 minutes less than the time taken by the army. </p></div></div><div class="mb-16"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">The Legal Victory</h2><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8"><div><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Challenge</h3><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"> When Guinness would not concede them the &#39;first&#39; title, the Chowdhurys filed a case against Guinness Publishing Limited in the Calcutta High Court.
